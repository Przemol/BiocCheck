- using T and F instead of TRUE/FALSE? (I think R CMD check only checks for this in default param values)
- ??check that tarball name is well formatted, i.e. that it matches what's in the DESCRIPTION file for
Version: and Package:?? Not sure if R CMD check already does this.
- Is version number ok for a new package? (0.99.z). We'd need to know if the package is intended to be a new package.
- do vignettes, man pages, and anything else (?) contain non-ascii/accented characters?
