algorithm for finding library/require(mypkg):

find SYMBOL_FUNCTION_CALL library or require
foreach of them:
    go down 1 row, get parent, call it p, call this row i1
    get last row with parent p, call that i2.
    between i and i2 (non-inclusive) is a row with either sybol, epxr or STR_CONST whose text is (?) mypkg, mypkg, 'mypkg', or "mypkg"
